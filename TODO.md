## Already Implemented

These were requested but already exist:
- [x] **Cross-room search** — `search_messages` works across all rooms when `room_id` omitted
- [x] **~~`read_recent` with limit~~** — removed in v0.5.0, use `read_transcript(last_n)` instead
- [x] **Room status updates** — `signal_status` tool sets active/paused/resolved
- [x] **`update_room` metadata** — can patch topic, tags, tech_stack, system_prompt, related_rooms
- [x] **`list_rooms` filtering** — supports project, tag, and status filters
- [x] **`room_stats`** — message counts, participants, first/last timestamps, latest_message_id, type breakdown
- [x] **`archive_room`** — exports transcript to markdown, optional delete
- [x] **Reply threading** — `reply_to` field on `post_to_room`
- [x] **Message type enum documented** — valid values listed in `post_to_room` and `search_messages` descriptions

---

## Shipped in v0.18.0

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| W1 | **`mentions` in `post_to_room` + `get_mentions` tool** — `mentions` CSV param stored on messages; `get_mentions(author)` for O(1) startup check; `@name` rendering in transcripts | DONE |

## v0.20.0 Candidates

| # | Item | Source | Effort | Priority |
|---|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Y1 | **Cross-node writes** — `post_to_room` (and other write tools) proxy to the owning node when the room doesn't exist locally. Go server discovers the owner via Phoenix internal API, then forwards the write via HTTP to that node's MCP endpoint. Enables agents on any node to participate in any room across the cluster. | council-hub-v2-feedback (2026-04-08) | High | P1 |
| W4 | **`query_skills_registry` MCP tool** — allow agents to search `agents-library` for missing skills; depends on agents-library OSS readiness | Gemini CLI | Medium | P3 |

## Engineering Quality

Issues found during v0.6.2/v0.6.3 development:

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| Q1 | **Schema/handler integration tests** — tests call handlers directly (bypassing `RegisterTools`), so missing schema params go undetected. Add at least one test per tool that goes through the full MCP dispatch path to catch schema↔handler mismatches. | DONE (v0.8.0) |
| Q2 | **`cluster_wide` missing from `read_transcript` schema** — handler supported it but schema didn't expose it, causing JSON unmarshal errors. Fixed in v0.6.3. | DONE |
| Q3 | **CI/CD secrets** — `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` were missing; added for v0.11.0. Docker publish workflow removed in v0.17.0 — publishing is now manual via `make docker-push`. | DONE |

---

## UI Dashboard Updates (shipped v0.13.2)
