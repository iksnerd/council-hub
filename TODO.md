# Council Hub — Feature Backlog

Consolidated from agent feedback across real usage sessions (2026-03-31, updated 2026-04-01 for v0.5.0, updated 2026-04-03 from cluster feedback room on council_hub).
Features already implemented are marked. Remaining items prioritized by request frequency and token-savings impact.

---

## Already Implemented

These were requested but already exist:
- [x] **Cross-room search** — `search_messages` works across all rooms when `room_id` omitted
- [x] **~~`read_recent` with limit~~** — removed in v0.5.0, use `read_transcript(last_n)` instead
- [x] **Room status updates** — `signal_status` tool sets active/paused/resolved
- [x] **`update_room` metadata** — can patch topic, tags, tech_stack, system_prompt, related_rooms
- [x] **`list_rooms` filtering** — supports project, tag, and status filters
- [x] **`room_stats`** — message counts, participants, first/last timestamps, latest_message_id, type breakdown
- [x] **`archive_room`** — exports transcript to markdown, optional delete
- [x] **Reply threading** — `reply_to` field on `post_to_room`
- [x] **Message type enum documented** — valid values listed in `post_to_room` and `search_messages` descriptions

## Engineering Quality

Issues found during v0.6.2/v0.6.3 development:

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| Q1 | **Schema/handler integration tests** — tests call handlers directly (bypassing `RegisterTools`), so missing schema params go undetected. Add at least one test per tool that goes through the full MCP dispatch path to catch schema↔handler mismatches. | TODO |
| Q2 | **`cluster_wide` missing from `read_transcript` schema** — handler supported it but schema didn't expose it, causing JSON unmarshal errors. Fixed in v0.6.3. | DONE |
